## `What is Router Nitro ?`

Router Nitro is a cross-chain swapping engine or protocol designed to enable cross-chain asset transfers. It serves as a mechanism for seamlessly moving digital assets or tokens between different blockchain networks

The Lastest Version employs a trustless method for managing cross-chain asset transfers. In this system, a forwarder entity delivers the requested asset to the user on the destination chain. After confirming the forwarder's successful settlement on the destination chain, they can access the user's deposited funds on the source chain

## `Build Don't Talk`

In this tutorial we'll be building an AI DApp which can execute CrossChain Transactions based on prompts.
